Deprecated/Obsolete APIs
========================

Deprecations
------------

These functions *are not* intended for user use and will be removed in the next
version. In most cases these have no use in the codebase as of v3.3.0.

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:

   regrid

Note the functions ``compare_arrays`` and ``regression_tests`` (version 3.3.0
and earlier) related to testing only so have been moved out of the
functional codebase.


Obsolete Internal API
---------------------

These routines were exposed in the user-facing API at versions 3.3.0 and
below but were marked as not being intended for user use. They have
therefore been removed except for under-the-hood processing at version 3.5.0.
They are listed here for completeness and posterity.

If you made use of any of the functionality provided by these internal-use
routines, and wish to have this in future, please
:ref:`get in touch <ways-to-contact-us>` to let
us know and we may be able to support them again.
